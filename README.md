I have found the below observations from given homework "HeroesOfPymoli".
    There are 576 active players, the majority are male players (84%) and small amount of female players (14%).
    The majority participants are in age group between 20-24 (44.8%), then the next group of participants are in age groups falling between 15-19 (18.60%) and 25-29 (13.4%).
    "Final Critic" is the most popular and profitable item.
    
    
 Output I have got is in same format in Jupyter Notebook as instructed(table format). But the format of the dataframe showing differently in github.
